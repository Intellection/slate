# API Overview

Zappi allows 3rd parties to create public integrations on our platform. This will allow other companies and developers to build integrations which can be installed by different customer groups. All public integrations will need to be reviewed and approved by Zappi. Access tokens for public integrations will expire, and will need to be regenerated when necessary, using the client credentials oAuth flow. In order to make use of a public integration, a customer group will need to install it. Public integrations can be uninstalled at any point in time.

## Public Integrations

In order for a public integration to be made available, the 3rd-party would need to register this public integration on our platform.

Public Integrations will need to be reviewed and approved by Zappi. Once an integration has been approved by Zappi, this integration will be made available to customers on the platform.

Each Public Integration will be assigned the following:

Field | Description
--------- | -----------
Client ID | The client identifier to be used for oAuth Client Credentials flow
Client Secret | The client secret to be used for oAuth Client Credentials flow

### Installation

Once a Public Integration is installed on a subdomain, the Public Integration will be able to make API requests on behalf of the customer group.
